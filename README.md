# Health-Disparities-Study
A Study of Health Disparity of Dental Care Across London Boroughs in Relation to Average Household Income
This code is used in a report which examines the health disparity in dental care across various London boroughs in relation to average household income. It evaluates the changing health inequalities in London over time and the impact of UK government policies, with a particular focus on the period from 2010-2013 in which the dataset is based. It investigates the boroughs with the lowest household income and explores the factors contributing to this phenomenon, such as employment and structural disadvantages such as marginalisation and accessibility challenges. The report utilises dental data of 0-19 year olds across London boroughs, with discussion on the challenges in accessing free dental care within the NHS. Overall, the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.3647 and the statistically significant p-value of 0.0176 indicate a moderate positive relationship between income and tooth extraction decay. However, it is important to consider other factors that may influence dental health outcomes, such as oral hygiene practices, access to dental care, and language and cultural barriers.
